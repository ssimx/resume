  Hi, my name is Simon, I'm 25 years old and I'm a junior full stack web developer. In addition to making web apps, I also have experience as a system administrator. 
  As a high school student, I attended many startup events where I learned how to be a team player.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>NextJs</mark> and lifting weights

          Full stack social media application that replicates X's (formerly known as Twitter) core functionality
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project with the intention of expanding my knowledge of <mark>React</mark> by learning one of the modern frameworks, and I decided on <mark>NextJs</mark>, as it is currently very popular.
          In addition to front-end programming, I was also interested in the back-end, so I decided to implement a separate API using <mark>NodeJs</mark> & <mark>ExpressJs</mark> and <mark>PostgreSQL</mark> & <mark>Prisma ORM</mark> tech stack.
          Until this point, I was using Javascript for all my projects but for this project, I decided to take a step forward and learn <mark>Typescript</mark>.
          It took me 6 months to build this application, and it has grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many new skills and I am very proud to be able to show a slightly more serious project in my portfolio.

          Front end application that replicates Epic Games Store design
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          After more than half a year of learning vanilla Javascript, I started this project as an introduction to the front-end world of the web development by using the most popular JS library - <mark>React</mark>.
          The app was built by using <mark>Vite</mark> framework and there is no back-end so it's not fully functional but it does have a beautiful modern design.

          This project is where I believe I "mastered" <mark>vanilla JS</mark>. I must admit that I'm very proud of this project. 
          In my opinion, this is what allows me to say that unlike other junior developers who only know how to "React", I actually know how to "JavaScript".

          It forces you to figure out and complete the assigment on your own
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          What differentiates The Odin Project from all those other courses and curriculums out there is its unique way of providing guidance and answers to the most important questions, 
          while also strengthening your ability to push through the curriculum and projects by yourself and grow from your struggles. 
          As you learn how to code, you build dozens of portfolio-worthy projects, from simple scripts to full programs and websites. 
          I cannot stress enough how important this course is if you're a self-learner aiming to become a web developer.

          It teaches you how to solve problems with low-level programming language C
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I will quote Professor David J. Malan:

          "In C, there's no magic. If you want something to be somewhere in memory, you have to put it there yourself. 
           If you want a hash table, you have to implement it yourself. The result by term's end, we hope, 
           is that students understand how things work from the bottom up and, better yet, can explain as much."

          This is why I fell in love with CS50x. After I completed it, I didn't just learn C, I learned how to program. 
          This foundation enabled me to teach myself JavaScript, and I'm confident I would be able to learn and handle any other programming language.

          During my time at ŠC Nova Gorica, I learned mostly about system administration and networks. There was some web development covered, but nothing significant. 
          I feel like this was not useful for me, which is why I still need to write my diploma thesis and actually graduate. 
          Instead of 'wasting' my time on that, I decided I would rather spend my time learning how to program until I land a job and only then focus on the diploma.

  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Following the completion of my formal education, I couldn't see myself in either programming or system administration, so I set out to explore emerging fields to determine my career direction. 
      This explains my lack of working experience and what might appear as a 'career break'.
      
      Given the significant attention surrounding cryptocurrency and Web3 technologies at that time, I committed myself to thoroughly researching this space to gain a deeper understanding of its 
      fundamental concepts and applications and to earn money of course.

      Some things I did:
      - Read up about how blockchain works, Bitcoin, NFTs, Play-To-Earn, DAOs, …
      - Earn a living by trading coins and NFTs
      - Wrote an NFT contract in Solidity and deployed it on the Ethereum network

      During this time, I got to talk to and learn from some really smart folks in the crypto world.

      While I believe that there's huge opportunity and potential (especially in DeFi), at this time I don't think Web3 is where I'm supposed to be, 
      that's why I've decided to pursue career in web2 coding instead.

      Alongside my interests in software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Weightlifting
      - Crypto
      - Sports
      - Gaming
