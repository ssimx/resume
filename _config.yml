  Hi, my name's Simon and I'm a junior full stack web developer. As well as making web apps I also have experience as a system administrator. 
  As a high school student, I attended many startup events, where I learned how to be a team player.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>NextJs</mark> and lifting weights

          Full stack social media application that replicates X's (formerly known as Twitter) core functionality
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project with the intention of expanding my knowledge of <mark>React</mark> by learning one of the modern frameworks, and I decided on <mark>NextJs</mark>, as it is currently very popular.
          In addition to front-end programming, I was also interested in the back-end, so I decided to implement a separate API using <mark>NodeJs</mark> & ExpressJs and <mark>PostgreSQL</mark> & Prisma ORM tech stack.
          It took me 6 months to build this application, and it has grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many new skills and I am very proud to be able to show a slightly more serious project in my portfolio.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
